## About This Document
This document presents a brief introduction to the Coherence-Based Genealogical Method (CBGM), intended to bring newcomers and those in need of a refresher up to speed on the basics of the method. It is divided into sections organized around the core elements of the method. For didactic purposes, key concepts are introduced primarily through graphics and practical examples. While the document is over forty pages long, it contains over thirty figures, many of which take up their own pages. There is only about twelve pages' worth of textual content. Familiarity with New Testament Greek is necessary to understand the content of textual variants in some examples, but not necessary to understand how the CBGM works.
